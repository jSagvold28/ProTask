        <h3>
            Wide Range of Features
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have a ton of features in our ToDo Lists. I have a CLI and web based apps so anyone can have access to this application. Just to name a few: Adding tasks (web and CLI), fetching whole ToDo list (cli), pomodoro timer (web). And everyday I am fixing bugs, adding features or everything in between. Hope that you enjoy my ranage of features!

            CLI and Web support
        </h3>
        <p>
            Beleve it or not I support web and CLI apps. If you into programming: I coded the CLI app in a lightweight programming language called Lua. And the website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why we offer those? Because simply why not?!
