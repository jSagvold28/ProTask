# Hey, check out this version of Why Us: http://127.0.0.1:5500/.app/web/whyUs/index.html

## Wide Range of Features
I have a ton of features in our ToDo Lists. I have a CLI and web based apps so anyone can have access to this application. Just to name a few: Adding tasks (web and CLI), fetching whole ToDo list (cli), pomodoro timer (web). And everyday I am fixing bugs, adding features or everything in between. Hope that you enjoy my ranage of features!

# CLI and Web support
Beleve it or not I support web and CLI apps. If you into programming: I coded the CLI app in a lightweight programming language called Lua. And the website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why we offer those? Because simply why not?!

# Company Values
Our values are: value user privacy, we dont sell any of your data when you access our website or CLI app.

# One developer is making this!
This is simply for me making my own projecets that will be on my GitHub page. If you wanna fallow me my handle is jSagvold28. I would appreciate that if you would like to use my apps.
